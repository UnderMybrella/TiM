Tinker's Modifiers

Sometimes, as a modpack author, or even as a user, you just don't agree with the defaults. This is why we're here.

Tinkers' Modifiers allows you to change what modifiers are used by Tinkers' Construct (TiC), and allows you to omit them completely, modify existing modifiers, or add new ones!
